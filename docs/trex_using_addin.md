When a Tableau Add-In is installed, it appears on the dashboard sheet, under **Add-Ins**. You can use the add-in like you would any other dashboard object. For information about creating and installing an add-in, see [Creating a Tableau-Add-In](https://github.com/tableau/ProjectFrelard/wiki/Developer-Docs-:--Create-and-Use-a-Tableau-AddIn-(Project-Frelard)).

1. In a Tableau workbook, create a new dashboard or open an existing dashboard.  
2. Under **Add-Ins**,  select the add-in and drag it on to the dashboard. 
3. Configure the add-in, using the available controls.   
   The settings for the add-in are saved when you save the workbook. You can add multiple instances of an add-in to a dashboard or to multiple dashboards within a workbook. The settings for each instance are saved separately.
